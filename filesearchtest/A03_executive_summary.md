### Introduction

Hastur, a pivotal figure in the Cthulhu Mythos, embodies a complex blend of benevolence and cosmic horror. Originating in Ambrose Bierce's works and later integrated by Robert W. Chambers and H.P. Lovecraft, Hastur's powers span psychological manipulation, environmental control, and symbolic corruption. This report examines Hastur's canonical abilities, their evolution within the mythos, and contrasts these with Cthulhu's portrayal in *SMITE*, highlighting potential gameplay mechanics for Hastur's inclusion.

### Origins and Evolution of Hastur

- **Early Depiction**: Initially, Hastur was depicted as a benevolent deity in Bierce's *Haita the Shepherd*, overseeing natural phenomena and answering prayers[1][2].
- **Chambers' Influence**: In *The King in Yellow*, Hastur is linked to a forbidden play that induces madness, symbolizing psychological horror[1][2].
- **Lovecraftian Integration**: Lovecraft solidified Hastur as a Great Old One, emphasizing its role in destabilizing reality[2][3].

### Canonical Abilities and Powers of Hastur

- **Inducement of Madness**: Hastur's influence causes insanity through indirect means, such as the *King in Yellow* play, which erodes sanity and blurs reality[2][3].

- **Symbolic Corruption**: The Yellow Sign serves as a focal point for Hastur's influence, triggering madness and obsessive fixations[2][3].

### Comparative Analysis with Cthulhu in SMITE

- **Cthulhu's Mechanics**: In *SMITE*, Cthulhu is a physically dominant force with abilities that drain sanity and control environments[4].
- **Potential Hastur Mechanics**: Hastur could introduce subtlety and indirect control through abilities like *The Yellow Sign* (madness propagation), *Whispers of Carcosa* (wind and illusion), and *Rite of the King* (symbolic ultimates)[4].

### Potential Implementation of Hastur in SMITE

Implementing Hastur in *SMITE* would offer a unique playstyle centered on psychological manipulation and environmental control. This could include:

- **Madness Propagation**: Enemies would experience hallucinations or damage over time as their sanity erodes.
- **Wind and Illusion-Based Abilities**: Gusts of wind could obscure vision or displace enemies, combined with illusory duplicates.
- **Symbolic Ultimates**: The Yellow Sign could cause enemy abilities to backfire or target allies incorrectly.

### Conclusion

Hastur's canonical abilities provide a distinct profile within the Lovecraftian pantheon, emphasizing psychological horror and environmental manipulation. By integrating these elements into *SMITE*, the game could expand its strategic diversity while remaining faithful to Hastur's mythos legacy. This approach would differentiate Hastur from Cthulhu, offering players a fresh yet authentic cosmic horror experience.
