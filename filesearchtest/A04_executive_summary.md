# Executive Summary: How do Hastur's thematic associations with madness, forbidden knowledge, and cosmic indifference translate to MOBA gameplay mechanics in SMITE's existing design framework?

## Executive Summary: Integrating Hastur into SMITE

### Introduction

This report explores how the thematic associations of Hastur, a cosmic entity from Lovecraftian mythology, can be translated into MOBA gameplay mechanics within SMITE. By analyzing existing design frameworks and community responses, we outline a strategy for integrating Hastur's essence into SMITE's competitive ecosystem while maintaining thematic fidelity and competitive integrity.

### Key Findings

1. **Madness Mechanics**: Hastur's kit can incorporate **hallucinatory mechanics** that distort enemy perception, such as *Whispers of the King*, which impairs vision, and *Pallid Mask*, which taunts enemies into attacking allies. These abilities mirror the destabilizing effects of cosmic horror.

2. **Forbidden Knowledge**: Abilities like *Unveiled Truth* and *R’lyeh’s Grasp* leverage vision control and stat manipulation, reflecting the peril of uncovering hidden truths. These mechanics reward strategic play and embody the corrupting allure of forbidden power.

3. **Cosmic Indifference**: Hastur's ultimate, *Carcosa’s Descent*, embodies cosmic indifference through irreversible environmental shifts, affecting healing and silencing enemies within a large AoE. This ability symbolizes the inexorable spread of cosmic decay.

### Balancing Thematic Fidelity and Competitive Integrity

- **Counterplay and Risk-Reward Dynamics**: To ensure competitive fairness, Hastur's abilities must offer counterplay options, such as using *Relic: Purification Beads* to cleanse CC or dispelling marks by stepping into a friendly fountain.

- **Synergy with Existing Meta**: As a mage-support hybrid, Hastur fills a niche in SMITE's current meta, encouraging methodical playstyles and complementing objective-focused strategies.

### Community Reception and Precedent

- **Lessons from Recent Reworks**: The reworks of characters like Arachne and Awilix highlight the importance of balancing innovation with thematic consistency. Community feedback suggests that Hastur's design should avoid alienating players while introducing new mechanics.

- **Anticipating Player Concerns**: Datamining reveals concerns about balance, particularly regarding global ultimates and vision manipulation. Tuning Hastur's numbers and incorporating visual cues can help mitigate these issues.

### Narrative Integration

- **Aesthetic Cohesion**: Hastur's design should evoke otherworldly dread through visuals and audio effects, such as a flowing yellow cloak and discordant whispers.

- **Lore-Driven Quests**: A limited-time questline could task players with uncovering fragments of the *King in Yellow* playbook, unlocking cosmetic rewards and fleshing out Hastur's backstory.

### Conclusion

Integrating Hastur into SMITE offers a unique opportunity to blend cosmic horror with MOBA mechanics. By translating madness, forbidden knowledge, and cosmic indifference into gameplay, Hastur can captivate players while respecting SMITE's competitive integrity. The success of this integration depends on balancing thematic immersion with gameplay fairness, a challenge that requires careful tuning and community feedback.

### Recommendations

1. **Mechanical Tuning**: Ensure that Hastur's abilities offer meaningful counterplay options to maintain competitive balance.
2. **Community Engagement**: Monitor player feedback and adjust Hastur's design to align with community expectations and thematic consistency.
3. **Narrative Integration**: Develop lore-driven content that enhances Hastur's backstory and aesthetic cohesion within the game.

By following these strategies, Hi-Rez Studios can successfully integrate Hastur into SMITE, enriching the game's narrative and gameplay depth while maintaining its competitive edge.
