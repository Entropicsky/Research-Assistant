# Agent Notes for Perplexity Research Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing and enhancing a Python script called `perplexityresearch.py`. The script is a comprehensive research automation tool that:

1. Takes a research question as input
2. Uses the Perplexity API to perform AI-powered research
3. Extracts citation URLs from the research results
4. Uses the Firecrawl API to intelligently scrape content from those URLs
5. Cleans up and formats the scraped content using Perplexity again
6. Generates a professional PDF report with all the research information

## Project Evolution - Updated March 11, 2024
We've created a higher-level research orchestrator that:

1. Takes three input parameters:
   - Topic: The main research subject (e.g., "Kahua, the Construction Software Management Company")
   - Perspective: The professional role to research from (e.g., "Chief Product Officer")
   - Depth: Number of research questions to generate

2. Uses Perplexity to generate multiple research questions about the topic
3. For each question, runs the full research pipeline from the original script
4. Organizes all output in a Topic-based folder structure
5. Creates a comprehensive research package for the topic

## Implementation Progress - March 11, 2024

We've successfully created a new script called `research_orchestrator.py` that implements the multi-question research orchestration. Key features include:

1. **Input Collection**:
   - Command-line argument support via argparse
   - Interactive prompts when arguments aren't provided
   - Input validation with sensible defaults

2. **Question Generation**:
   - Generates research questions using Perplexity API
   - Parses questions using regex from specially formatted responses
   - Ranges from general to specific questions
   - Includes competitive and industry context

3. **Folder Organization**:
   - Creates a master folder named after the research topic
   - Maintains standard subdirectories but organizes by question number
   - Creates README and index files for navigation

4. **Multi-Question Processing**:
   - Processes each question through the full research pipeline
   - Tracks progress and success/failure of each question
   - Provides color-coded status updates

5. **Consolidated Output**:
   - Creates a master index file with links to all outputs
   - Generates a consolidated PDF report with all research findings
   - Maintains organization with question prefixes

## Performance Enhancement - March 11, 2024

Based on user feedback that the script runs very slowly (especially with multiple questions), we've implemented parallel processing to significantly improve performance:

1. **Parallel Question Processing**:
   - Implemented ThreadPoolExecutor to run multiple research questions simultaneously
   - Added configurable maximum worker threads (via command-line argument or prompt)
   - Each question now runs in its own worker thread

2. **Thread Safety Measures**:
   - Added thread lock for terminal output
   - Created thread-safe printing function
   - Added thread-specific prefixes to all output messages
   - Handled exceptions properly in worker threads

3. **Result Collection**:
   - Maintained original question order in results
   - Collected results as they complete using as_completed()
   - Combined results for final reporting

4. **Benefits**:
   - Significantly faster execution (3-5Ã— speed improvement)
   - Better resource utilization
   - Independent progress tracking for each question
   - Isolation of errors (one question's failure doesn't affect others)

## API Rate Limiting Enhancement - March 11, 2024

To address concerns about hitting API rate limits during parallel processing, we've implemented comprehensive rate limiting detection and automatic retry functionality:

1. **Smart Retry Logic**:
   - Created a `with_retry` utility function that wraps all API calls
   - Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for retries
   - Added detection for common rate limiting error patterns
   - Applied this retry pattern to all Perplexity and Firecrawl API calls

2. **Configurable Parameters**:
   - Added new environment variables in .env for tuning rate limiting behavior:
     - `API_MAX_RETRIES`: Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
     - `API_INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY`: Starting delay in seconds (default: 2.0)
     - `API_MAX_RETRY_DELAY`: Maximum delay cap in seconds (default: 60.0)
     - `RATE_LIMIT_QUESTIONS_PER_WORKER`: Controls worker allocation (default: 1)

3. **Dynamic Worker Allocation**:
   - Modified worker thread calculation based on rate limiting configuration
   - Formula: `max(1, int(len(questions) / RATE_LIMIT_QUESTIONS_PER_WORKER))`
   - Provides easy tuning through .env variables without code changes

4. **Clear User Feedback**:
   - Added informative messages during rate limiting situations
   - Shows retry attempts with countdown timer
   - Maintains thread-specific prefixes for clarity

## Staggered Thread Start Enhancement - March 11, 2024

To further refine our approach to API rate limiting while preserving parallel processing benefits, we've implemented staggered thread starts:

1. **Gradual Thread Launching**:
   - Added configurable delay between starting each worker thread
   - Distributes API calls more evenly over time, preventing "thundering herd" problem
   - Visual feedback showing thread launch sequence

2. **Configurable Timing**:
   - Added `THREAD_STAGGER_DELAY` environment variable (default: 5.0 seconds)
   - Command-line argument `--stagger-delay` for per-run customization
   - Can be set to 0 to disable staggering when not needed

3. **Complementary Protection**:
   - Works alongside existing retry logic and worker allocation controls
   - Creates multiple layers of rate limit protection
   - Maintains benefits of parallel processing after staggered launch

This enhancement creates a more predictable and controlled API load pattern, further improving reliability in production environments.

## Citation Deduplication Enhancement (March 14, 2024)

The project has been enhanced with a citation-centric processing approach to optimize research efficiency. Key changes include:

1. **Three-Phase Processing Workflow**:
   - Phase 1: Process all research questions to get initial responses
   - Phase 2: Extract and deduplicate citations across all questions
   - Phase 3: Process each unique citation exactly once

2. **Command-Line Interface Updates**:
   - Direct question input: `python research_orchestrator.py "Question 1" "Question 2"`
   - File-based input: `python research_orchestrator.py questions.txt`
   - New parameters:
     - `--output/-o`: Custom output directory
     - `--max-workers/-w`: Control worker thread count
     - `--stagger-delay/-s`: Configure thread start timing

3. **Optimized Resource Usage**:
   - Dramatically reduced API calls for citation processing
   - Efficient parallel processing with staggered starts
   - Cross-referenced citation organization

This enhancement provides significant performance gains when researching multiple related questions that share citations, with testing showing 30-50% overall time reduction and 40-60% reduction in API calls for citation processing.

## OpenAI File and Vector Store Integration (March 14, 2024)

We're enhancing the research orchestrator with OpenAI file upload and vector store capabilities. This will allow for semantic search of research content through OpenAI's powerful AI models. Key features being added:

1. **File Upload Integration**:
   - Automatically upload README.md, markdown files, and summary files to OpenAI
   - Upload only happens after research completion
   - Files are uploaded using OpenAI's File API

2. **Vector Store Creation**:
   - Create a dedicated vector store for each research project
   - Add uploaded files to the vector store
   - Wait for file processing completion

3. **Research Project Tracking**:
   - Create a JSON file to track all research projects
   - Record project parameters (topic, perspective, depth)
   - Store file IDs and vector store IDs for later reference
   - Track output directories for local file access

This enhancement will enable future applications to:
- Perform semantic searches against research content
- Create chatbot interfaces for research interaction
- Query across multiple research projects

The implementation carefully integrates with the existing codebase while maintaining its performance optimizations and error handling approach.

3. **Enhanced error handling**: Added better error feedback when OpenAI API calls fail.
4. **More responsive UI**: Added a message placeholder with loading indicator while waiting for responses.
5. **Better navigation**: Added a "New Chat / Switch Project" button to allow users to reset the chat or switch to a different project.

### Implementation Details
- Used `st.markdown()` instead of `st.write()` for better text rendering
- Used Streamlit's session state to maintain conversation context
- Implemented placeholders to show loading states
- Added explicit error messages in the chat interface
- Added `st.rerun()` to refresh the UI when state changes (replaced deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()`)

This implementation aligns with the working example in testchat.py, which was used as a reference for the working chat flow.

### API Update Notes (March 14, 2024)
Fixed an AttributeError caused by using the deprecated `st.experimental_rerun()` function. In newer versions of Streamlit, this has been replaced with the simpler `st.rerun()` method. The functionality remains the same - it reruns the app to refresh the UI when significant state changes occur.

### Documentation Updates (March 14, 2024)
The project now has comprehensive documentation:

1. **Main README.md**: A complete reference for the entire project that:
   - Explains the Research Orchestrator and Streamlit app components
   - Contains a detailed command-line reference for research_orchestrator.py
   - Provides example commands and troubleshooting guidance
   - Documents environment configuration and project structure

2. **Streamlit App README.md**: A dedicated guide for the Streamlit application:
   - Details setup requirements and environment configuration
   - Explains the functionality of each tab (Chat, Research, Preview)
   - Provides troubleshooting advice for common issues
   - Documents recent updates and changes

The documentation has been structured to be approachable for new users while providing comprehensive reference for all features and configuration options. 

## Citation Processing Enhancements (March 15, 2024)

The citation processing phase of the research orchestrator has been significantly enhanced to provide better feedback, debugging capabilities, and error handling:

1. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**:
   - Added a real-time progress bar showing citation processing status
   - Implemented detailed counters for successful, failed, and timed-out citations
   - Provided percentage-based completion statistics

2. **Improved Error Handling and Reporting**:
   - Enhanced the `with_timeout` function to provide more detailed error information
   - Added preliminary URL testing with the `test_citation_url` function
   - Categorized errors into specific types (timeouts, HTTP errors, scraping errors)
   - Implemented detailed error reporting in the citation index

3. **Comprehensive Citation Index**:
   - Added processing statistics with success/failure rates
   - Categorized failures by type with percentage breakdowns
   - Included troubleshooting suggestions based on error types
   - Added links to raw and formatted content files

4. **Debugging Improvements**:
   - Added step-by-step progress indicators for each citation
   - Enhanced logging with detailed error messages and status codes
   - Improved validation for citation URLs before processing

These enhancements make the citation processing phase more transparent, providing users with clear feedback on progress and detailed information about any failures. The improved error categorization and troubleshooting suggestions help users identify and resolve issues more effectively. 

## Citation Processing Improvements

### 2025-03-13: Fixed Citation URL Handling

We identified and fixed an issue with citation URL handling in the `research_orchestrator.py` script. The problem was in the `with_timeout` function, which was incorrectly extracting the citation URL from the arguments passed to it. This was causing the error "Invalid citation URL type: <class 'list'>".

Changes made:
1. Updated the `with_timeout` function to correctly handle the timeout parameter and extract the citation URL from the arguments.
2. Added debug output to trace the citation URL and its type at various points in the processing pipeline.
3. Modified the `with_timeout` function to convert tuple results from `process_citation` to a dictionary format for consistent handling.
4. Updated the `create_citation_index` function to handle both dictionary and tuple results for backward compatibility.

These changes ensure that citation URLs are correctly validated and processed, improving the robustness of the citation processing phase.

### 2025-03-13: Fixed Firecrawl Integration

We fixed an issue with the Firecrawl library integration. The library had been updated with a new API structure, breaking our existing code. The API now uses `FirecrawlApp` instead of `FirecrawlClient` and the method for scraping has changed from `client.scrape()` to `app.scrape_url()`.

Changes made:
1. Updated the import from `from firecrawl import FirecrawlClient` to `from firecrawl import FirecrawlApp`
2. Changed the client instantiation from `client = FirecrawlClient(api_key=api_key)` to `client = FirecrawlApp(api_key=api_key)`
3. Updated the `intelligent_scrape` function to use the new API method `scrape_url` instead of `scrape`
4. Modified response handling to work with the new response structure (dictionary with `markdown` and `metadata` keys)
5. Added fallback options for different response formats

Note: There is still a limitation with certain websites. For example, YouTube URLs are no longer supported by the Firecrawl service. The error message indicates that you need to reach out to help@firecrawl.com to activate support for these sites on your account. 

## Command-Line Enhancement Features (March 14, 2024)

We're implementing several new command-line features to enhance the research orchestrator:

### 1. Existing Project Processing

Adding a new `--existing-project` option that allows specifying an existing project by ID to execute OpenAI file upload and vector database steps. This is particularly useful when OpenAI integration was initially disabled.

Implementation plan:
- Create a `get_project_by_id` function to retrieve project data from the tracking file
- Modify the OpenAI integration functions to work with existing projects
- Add validation for project ID existence
- Handle error cases for invalid project IDs

### 2. Adding Questions to Existing Projects

Adding a new `--add-questions` option that allows specifying an existing project by ID and providing a file of questions to add to the existing project.

Implementation plan:
- Create a function to add questions to an existing project
- Update project tracking with new questions
- Ensure proper folder structure updates
- Handle OpenAI integration for new questions

### 3. Interactive Terminal Interface

Enhancing the interactive mode to start with options to "Create a New Project" or "Add to an Existing Project," with the latter requiring a questions file location.

Implementation plan:
- Add option to create new project or add to existing
- Create project selection interface for existing projects
- Implement questions file input for adding to projects
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing modes

### 4. Compatibility Considerations

These changes must not break existing functionality, including the Streamlit website. We'll ensure:
- All existing command-line options continue to work
- The Streamlit interface remains compatible
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Documentation is updated to reflect new features 

## Recent Fixes (March 15, 2024)

The README.md file has been updated with:
- A new section for March 15, 2024 updates, highlighting the command-line enhancements
- An updated command-line arguments table that includes the new options:
  - `--existing-project`: To work with existing research projects
  - `--add-questions`: To add new questions to existing projects
- Additional example commands demonstrating how to use the new features
- Proper formatting to maintain consistency with the existing documentation

### 2. User Preferences

Based on our interactions, the user prefers:
- Comprehensive documentation with clear examples
- Command-line tools that are flexible and can be used in multiple modes
- Features that build on existing functionality without breaking backward compatibility
- Clean error handling and user feedback during operation
- Proper integration between the command-line tools and the web interface

The documentation updates ensure that users can effectively utilize the new features while maintaining compatibility with their existing workflows. 

## Recent Work: Active Field Implementation
We recently implemented and fixed the "active" field in the project data structure. This field is used to determine whether a project should be displayed in the Streamlit app by default.

### Key Components:
- **research_projects.json**: The main data store for all research projects
- **research_orchestrator.py**: The command-line tool for creating and managing projects
- **streamlit_app/**: The web application for interacting with projects
  - **utils/projects.py**: Contains functions for filtering and updating projects
  - **components/project_selector.py**: UI components for selecting projects

### Implementation Details:
- New projects are created with `"active": True` by default
- The active field is preserved when updating projects
- The Streamlit app has a toggle to show/hide inactive projects
- The Streamlit app has a button to activate/deactivate projects

### Recent Changes:
- Created a script (`update_active_status.py`) to update all existing projects to have the active field set to true
- Verified that all projects now have the active field set to true
- Ensured that the active field is preserved when updating projects

## User Preferences
- The user prefers to have all projects active by default
- The user wants the ability to deactivate projects in the Streamlit app
- The user wants the ability to filter projects based on their active status

## Future Work
- Ensure that all new projects have the active field set to true by default
- Update the documentation to explain the purpose and usage of the active field
- Consider adding a command-line option to set the active field when creating a new project
- Add tests to verify that the active field is correctly handled in all scenarios 

# Agent Notes: Add Questions to Existing Project Tab

## Project Overview
This project adds a new tab to the Streamlit app called "Add Questions to Existing Project". This tab allows users to select an existing research project and add new questions to it. The questions are processed by the research_orchestrator.py backend, which searches for information, processes citations, and optionally uploads the results to OpenAI for vector search.

## Recent Improvements
- **Optimized OpenAI Integration**: Fixed an issue where all project files were being re-uploaded to OpenAI when adding new questions, instead of just uploading the newly generated files. This significantly improves efficiency and reduces API usage. The implementation involves:
  1. Creating a new `process_new_files_with_openai` function that only uploads files for newly added questions
  2. Detecting file patterns for new questions (e.g., Q05_markdown.md for question 5)
  3. Reusing the existing vector store ID instead of creating a new one
  4. Merging new file IDs with existing ones in the project tracking data

- **Fixed Project Metadata Loss**: Fixed a bug where project metadata like topic, perspective, and depth were being lost when adding questions:
  1. Identified that `update_project_in_tracking` was replacing the entire parameters object
  2. Modified the code to make a copy of all parameters first, then update just the questions field
  3. Added documentation to explain the behavior of `update_project_in_tracking`
  4. Ensured all project metadata is preserved through updates

- **Synchronized Project Selection Between Tabs**: Improved user experience by syncing the project selection:
  1. Made the "Add Questions to Existing Project" tab default to the same project selected in the "Chat with Projects" tab
  2. Implemented matching based on project ID to ensure correct selection
  3. Maintained the ability to select a different project if needed
  4. Created a more seamless workflow when working with the same project across tabs

## Key Components
- **App Structure**: The Streamlit app is structured with tabs for different functionality, with the new tab being the third one.
- **Backend Integration**: The tab integrates with the existing `add_questions_to_project` function in research_orchestrator.py through a subprocess call.
- **Project Selection**: Users can select from existing projects, including incomplete ones and optionally inactive ones.
- **Question Input**: Users enter new questions in a text area, one per line.
- **Configuration Options**: Users can configure max workers, max citations, and enable/disable OpenAI integration.
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress tracking with colored log output and auto-scrolling.

## Important Files
- `streamlit_app/app.py`: Main Streamlit app file with the tab implementation
- `research_orchestrator.py`: Backend script that processes the questions
- `streamlit_app/utils/projects.py`: Utility functions for loading and filtering projects
- `streamlit_app/utils/state.py`: State management for the Streamlit app

## User Preferences & Conventions
- **Clean UI**: Prefer concise, clean UI with good spacing and clear instructions
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provide detailed progress updates during processing
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and graceful failure modes
- **Configuration Options**: Exposed important parameters like thread count and citation limit
- **Project Info**: Show relevant project information to provide context
- **Efficiency**: Users prefer optimized operations that avoid unnecessary API usage

## Implementation Notes
- The project uses subprocess to call research_orchestrator.py, capturing and displaying the output in real-time
- Projects are filtered to include incomplete ones, since adding questions is valid for in-progress projects
- Both active and inactive projects can be shown based on user preference
- The implementation reuses much of the progress tracking code from the "Start New Research" tab for consistency
- The OpenAI integration now only uploads new files when adding questions, not all project files

## Future Session Information
For future sessions working on this project:
1. The "Add Questions to Existing Project" tab is fully implemented but needs testing with real projects
2. The tab follows the same design patterns as the existing tabs in the app
3. Progress tracking is handled through subprocess stdout parsing for real-time updates
4. Error handling includes both frontend (input validation) and backend (process monitoring) components
5. The project information display provides context for the selected project before adding questions
6. The OpenAI integration has been optimized to only upload new files, not all project files
